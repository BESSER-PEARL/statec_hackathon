## Scope & transformations
- Subset/filters used, time window, indicators.
- Cleaning, joins, derived variables, sampling, anonymization/pseudonymization.

## Quality & limitations
- Known gaps (coverage, timeliness), measurement error, model assumptions.
- Representativeness, reproducibility constraints, compute limits.

## Legal, privacy & ethics
- No personal/confidential data in repo.
- Respect source licenses; cite clearly.
- Risks/harms considered; mitigations (aggregation, thresholds, suppression).

## Reproducibility
- Minimal steps to re-create results from clean sources.
- Deterministic seeds & environment listed in `requirements.txt`/`environment.yml`.
